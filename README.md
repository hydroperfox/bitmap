# Lightbitmap

Build complex bitmaps in your mobile phone.

* Bitmap = pixel grid
* Bitmap channels = red, green, blue, alpha
* Sketch shapes and rasterize them as you wish.

## Shapes

Any shape form is possible; whether it has open contours or not. You start a shape by touching there and there, and you may use curve control points around the points you touched.

Once a shape is good enough, you may rasterize it into a bitmap and perform complex graphics.
